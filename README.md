# VendingMachine-API
This is my attempt at a backend API for a vending machine using ExpressJS and PostgreSQL

In order to run the application, you need the following:
1. Node.js and npm: You can download them from the official website: (https://nodejs.org/).
2. PostgreSQL: Youâ€™ll need a PostgreSQL database for this tutorial.
3. Next, install the required dependencies
```
npm install express sequelize sequelize-cli pg

```
